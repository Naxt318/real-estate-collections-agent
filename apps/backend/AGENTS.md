## NestJS

This app's version of NestJS is likely newer than what you know. https://docs.nestjs.com/llms.txt indexes its documentation, with a markdown page per chapter. Check Nest's first-party packages before adding another library or writing your own.

Nest's packages are ESM only, and this project is ESM too: relative imports end in `.js`, `__dirname` doesn't exist (use `import.meta.dirname`), and tests run on Vitest, so mocks are `vi.fn()`, not `jest.fn()`.

The product and engineering rules for this repository are in the root `CLAUDE.md`.
